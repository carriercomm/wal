#
# -- [[ Collaborative Detection Scoring Initialization and Threshold Levels ]] ------------------------------
#
# These variables are used in macro expansion in the 49 inbound blocking and 59
# outbound blocking files.
#
# **MUST HAVE** ModSecurity v2.5.12 or higher to use macro expansion in numeric
# operators.  If you have an earlier version, edit the 49/59 files directly to
# set the appropriate anomaly score levels.
#
# You should set the score level (rule 900003) to the proper threshold you 
# would prefer.  If set to "5" it will work similarly to previous Mod CRS rules
# and will create an event in the error_log file if there are any rules that
# match.  If you would like to lessen the number of events generated in the 
# error_log file, you should increase the anomaly score threshold to something 
# like "20".  This would only generate an event in the error_log file if there
# are multiple lower severity rule matches or if any 1 higher severity item matches.
