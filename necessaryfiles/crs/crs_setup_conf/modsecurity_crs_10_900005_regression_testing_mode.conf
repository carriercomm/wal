# -- [[ Regression Testing Mode ]] --------------------------------------------------------
#
# If you are going to run the regression testing mode, you should uncomment the
# following rule. It will enable DetectionOnly mode for the SecRuleEngine and
# will enable Response Header tagging so that the client testing script can see
# which rule IDs have matched.
#
# You must specify the your source IP address where you will be running the tests
# from.
