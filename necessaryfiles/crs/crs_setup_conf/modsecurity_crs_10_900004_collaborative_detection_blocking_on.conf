# 
# -- [[ Collaborative Detection Blocking ]] -----------------------------------------------
#
# This is a collaborative detection mode where each rule will increment an overall
# anomaly score for the transaction. The scores are then evaluated in the following files:
#
# Inbound anomaly score - checked in the modsecurity_crs_49_inbound_blocking.conf file
# Outbound anomaly score - checked in the modsecurity_crs_59_outbound_blocking.conf file
#
# If you want to use anomaly scoring mode, then uncomment this line.
