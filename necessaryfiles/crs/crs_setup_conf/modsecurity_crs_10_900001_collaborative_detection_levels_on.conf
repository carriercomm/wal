#
# -- [[ Collaborative Detection Severity Levels ]] ----------------------------------------
#
# These are the default scoring points for each severity level.  You may
# adjust these to you liking.  These settings will be used in macro expansion
# in the rules to increment the anomaly scores when rules match.
#
# These are the default Severity ratings (with anomaly scores) of the individual rules -
#
#    - 2: Critical - Anomaly Score of 5.
#         Is the highest severity level possible without correlation.  It is
#         normally generated by the web attack rules (40 level files).
#    - 3: Error - Anomaly Score of 4.
#         Is generated mostly from outbound leakage rules (50 level files).
#    - 4: Warning - Anomaly Score of 3.
#         Is generated by malicious client rules (35 level files).
#    - 5: Notice - Anomaly Score of 2.
#         Is generated by the Protocol policy and anomaly files.
